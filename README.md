# MTG Deck Image Downloader

This tool downloads Magic: The Gathering card images and saves the deck list as image files. (and also text files too)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x you can get it from www.python.org/downloads/  if you don't have it 
- `requests` module (install by running "Run this first.py" as admin (it should close right after you run it) and if that doesn't work and you still get errors about it put "pip install requests" in the command prompt)
- internet

HOW TO USE
Step 1: 
UNZIP ZIP FILE TO FOLDER
then run run this second.bat as admin (it might break without admin but mabye not idk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) put in your mtg friends from archidekt (INPORTANT: UNCHECK ALL archidekt EXPORT OPTIONS OR IT WILL NOT WORK) and add another line that says DONE and press enter and it should start :D if you want to test the program to see if the program is just broken or you messed something up you can with the txt file called: test mtg friends to test it to see if it works.txt and copy and paste that

Step 2: 
to find the images it is in the Downloaded files folder in this zip folder thingy (the folder should auto generate if you did everything correctly)
