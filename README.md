# MTG Deck Image Downloader

This tool downloads Magic: The Gathering card images and saves the deck list as image files. (and also text files too)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x you can get it from www.python.org/downloads/  if you don't have it 
- internet

## HOW TO USE
### Step 1: 
unzip file to folder

### Step 2:
 run the thing called Click Me.bat (its called click this second in older versions) and run it as admin (it might work without but idk) put in your mtg friends from archidekt (INPORTANT: UNCHECK ALL ARCHIDEKT EXPORT OPTIONS OR IT WILL NOT WORK) and add another line that says DONE and press enter and it should start :D

### Step 3: 
to find the images it is in the Downloaded files folder in this zip folder thingy (the folder should auto generate if you did everything correctly)

## Troubleshooting

If you get any errors (that are red) [if they are not red they are not errors prob] that have to do with "requests" then my auto installer is broken and do this instead to fix it
1: go to command prompt terminal thing (its called cmd) and run that as admin
2: enter "pip install requests"
3: it will install and it will work


if it says anything like invalid card or something like that then make sure you use these options

and also to start it make another line with enter and type exactly DONE and click enter
another thing you can do is if you want to test the program to see if the program is just broken or you messed something up you can with the txt file called: test mtg friends to test it to see if it works.txt and copy and paste that

if it says anything about python and its not installed install it here www.python.org/downloads/
